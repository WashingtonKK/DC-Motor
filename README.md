I am modelling a permanent magnet DC motor using MATLAB simulink.
The approach used is through simscape rather than using the electrical approach.

The model is made basically for learning purposes and to train myself to use MATLAB tools for simulation.
I am also attempting to put my skills gained from classwork to practise.
Enjoy!
